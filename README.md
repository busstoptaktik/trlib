# TRLIB DISCONTINUED #

trlib is the transformation library originating at the Danish Geodetic Institute, GI, in the 1960s. It includes official transformations for Danish, Faroese and Greenlandic reference systems.

**The library is declared final at version 1.1**

Version 2.0, also present in the code base is an abandoned “future” version.

trlib functionality is currently being reimplemented as part of the (much more widespread) PROJ.4 library. https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/

Also, see https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/388
for some initial discussions specificly targeting preparations for trlib reimplementation.
